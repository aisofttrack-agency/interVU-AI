🎓 AI-Based Mock Interview Preparation System
📘 Major Project Report
Title: AI-Based Mock Interview Preparation System
Domain: Artificial Intelligence / Web Development
Technology Stack: Next.js, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, Vapi AI, Google Gemini
📖 Abstract
This project presents a web-based AI-powered mock interview platform aimed at helping job aspirants prepare effectively for real-world interviews. The system simulates interview environments using voice-based AI agents and evaluates candidate performance through real-time feedback and advanced scoring metrics powered by large language models.
The platform allows users to create interviews based on role, experience level, and technology stack. During interviews, voice agents ask AI-generated questions and record responses. After session completion, structured feedback is generated analyzing communication skills, technical proficiency, confidence, cultural fit, and problem-solving ability.
The application demonstrates the practical application of Generative AI, speech-based interfaces, cloud authentication, and modern full-stack development.
