# 🎓 AI-Based Mock Interview Preparation System

## Major Project – Artificial Intelligence & Web Development

### Abstract
This project is a web‑based AI powered mock interview platform that conducts voice‑based interview simulations and provides automated feedback using modern AI models. The system generates interview questions dynamically based on job role, experience level and technical skill set. An AI voice agent interacts with candidates in real‑time and after the interview transcript is analyzed to produce both numerical scoring and qualitative feedback across communication, technical ability, problem‑solving, confidence, and cultural fit.
